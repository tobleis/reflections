When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

  When I want to collaborate with others, as a remote backup, when I want to work on a project from multiple computers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Working locally on a change, while somebody else is working on the same file.
  This would overwrite my current version.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

  Fork = cloning of a repository on GitHub; clone = local version of remote repository;
  Branch = different tree within either remote and/or local repository

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Can work offline (e.g. on a plane or train)

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Use a directory on a server, different file names. Nothing easier.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    When multiple people are working on a version concurrently. Merging is more complicated,
    but can't destroy a working version and still push changes to the repo.
